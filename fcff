<h2><u>History of the sport</u></h2>
<p id="index"><text-align: left;>Water polo is a team water sport involving six players, and ball, and a goalkeeper.
 The game is usually played in a designated area of a swimming pool, but can also be played in lakes and streams.
 The object of water polo is to score goals. Water polo players swim and tread water while passing the ball and defending
their teammates, with the aim of moving the ball into the net defended by a goalie. The team with the most scored goals wins.
 The game is divided into four periods of varying lengths depending on the level of play, with short breaks in between.
 The home team wears numbered blue caps, the visiting team white numbered caps, and the goalies wear red caps.</p>
